\section{Project Description}
\label{sec:project_description}

\subsection{Product Goal}


\subsection{Motivation}
automate a dull task. Really dull. Could be dirty, in the sun. 

It takes a lot of time, can do overnight for like airports so dont have to worry about paying people. This improves infrastructure quality

Also makes sports things easier to maintain.

Fun thing with children for chalk drawings. Toy. Get the robot to bring your picture to life. 

\subsection{Product Scope}
\textbf{We want to talk about whats in scope and what might be out of scope}

its multi-agent. could have tons of robots. Right now we have 2 as a test bed. 

while many use cases involve large scale applications like stadiums we are going to do smaller things like on a poster. Expanding to this would involve making same robots but more durable (ie function outside)

explore uses of different types of writing implements/surfaces: sharpies vs chalk vs spray paint vs markers. Wont explore all but explore some. Might use liquid chalk

\subsection{Assumptions}
Some introduction to this blah blah
\begin{list}{A\arabic{qcounter}:~}{\usecounter{qcounter}}
\item Working on flat, homogenous surface (ie no muddy ground - thats out of scope - reference that section)
\item Manually loaded writing implement. 
\item Using writing utensil that writes like a pencil, ie not spray something
\item Clear, perfect communication (no noise). Robots can communicate quickly and fairly perfectly in a timely manner
\end{list}

%\subsection{Constraints}
%Have labels (C1, C2 ..)
%\begin{list}{C\arabic{qcounter}:~}{\usecounter{qcounter}}
%\item Item one
%\item Item two
%\item Item three
