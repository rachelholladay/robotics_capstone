\section{Installation Plan}
\label{sec:installation_plan}
The system needs a large (at least 6ft by 6ft), flat indoor surface on which to draw. To ease cleanup, we will cover the working surface with blackboard paper. The corners of the workspace will be fixed with AprilTags. There also must be a ceiling above the workspace low enough to mount the webcam, but high enough to allow the webcam a full view of the workspace. This means that the ceiling must be between 7 ft and 15 ft above the floor.

We will also need a single outlet to plug in the power strip used for charging the central processing laptop and the battery chargers for the robot.
