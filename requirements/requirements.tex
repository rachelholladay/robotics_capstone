\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}
We outline our systems requirements, both functional and nonfunctional. For each requirement we provide a number, for each of reference, a short description and a longer explanation. We prioritize our system requirements on a Likert scale from 1 to 7, detailed below. 

\CheckTable{1}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:functional_requirements}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Move in 4 Directions}{1}
\item Robot needs to be able to move forward, backward, to its left, and to its right. 
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Autonomous}{1}
\item After inputting images, robots need to complete paintings by themselves, without explicit human control. 
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Robots Localize Globally and Locally}{1}
\item During operation, robots need to know their locations with respect to each other and with respect to external world. 
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Safe}{1}
\item During operation, robots cannot run into things and damage external components.
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Within Bounds}{1}
\item While painting, robots need to stay within bounds of drawing.
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Change Tools}{1}
\item Changing painting tools need to be easy and fast. \yjnote{quantify?}
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Drive Control System}{1}
\item Details
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Turn on or off writing tool}{1}
\item Be able to lift painting tool up and down while moving, resulting in dashed lines. 
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Input drawing Plan}{1}
\item how well can you give it commands
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Robots Know Progress}{1}
\item Keep track of how much you have drawn
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Kill Switch}{1}
\item Users can immediately power off robots for safety.
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{User Interface to robot}{1}
\item how it gets controlled
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Be In Budget}{1}
\item Total developing cost of this robotic system needs to be within ...
\end{functional_requirement}

\begin{functional_requirement}{Documentation}{1}
\item Keep code and design documentation
\end{functional_requirement}


\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:nonfunctional_requirements}

\begin{nonfunctional_requirement}{Portable}{1}
\item Small, can be carried, easy to move around. Weight less than 50 pounds. Size: bigger than 2 foot cube
\end{nonfunctional_requirement}

\begin{nonfunctional_requirement}{Completes Task in Timely manner}{1}
\item Details
\end{nonfunctional_requirement}

\begin{nonfunctional_requirement}{Quality}{1}
\item Matches input well. 
\end{nonfunctional_requirement}

\begin{nonfunctional_requirement}{Mobile App}{1}

\end{nonfunctional_requirement}

\begin{nonfunctional_requirement}{Reliability}{1}
\item Percent up time
\end{nonfunctional_requirement}

\begin{nonfunctional_requirement}{Battery Life}{1}
\item Needs to last
\end{nonfunctional_requirement}

\begin{nonfunctional_requirement}{Fault Tolerance}{1}
\item Needs to last
\end{nonfunctional_requirement}

\begin{nonfunctional_requirement}{Coordination}{1}
