Meeting with Cam 2.28.17
Pre-meeting for milestone 2 presentation

3D PRINTING ISSUES
- can contact Cam for who to talk to w/ regard to 3D printing
    - if printers don't work

DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS
same as expected

PROJECT MANAGEMENT
how we're coming along in schedule

RISK MANAGEMENT
consequence/likelihood/risk dictionary:
- instead of overall consequence/likelihood, use risk plan worksheet template
- instead of colored grid of likelihood/consequence for all risk,
- have likelihood/consequence grid for EACH risk showing where it falls

- <10 risks, talk about each one individually
    - not spending too long on each one
- we have ~12, talk about most (leave out low quality ones or merge them)

content of project description should be consistent
    Make sure to add detail on top of WBS
        Update WBS accordingly to match new/updated risks

risk here focus on build/development/schedule delay-related risks
