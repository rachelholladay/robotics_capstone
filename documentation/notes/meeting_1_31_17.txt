MEETING NOTES 1/31/17
Meeting with professor

-------Presentation notes/structure:
- wbs/dict 40%
- schedule 40%
- general progress 15% - try to show visual of unfinished things too
- oral presentation 5% - part of individual grade
- feedback in class on other presentations = attendance/participation grade

- system design overview brief - concept, tech performance measures
- subsystem status (colorize wbs?)
- design mods since CDR
- key ongoing design efforts
- prototyping efforts if any
- schedule

- show a few wbs dict entries
- pick part of schedule (row of gantt chart, for ex.) and talk through

talking about sw progress:
    - slides of text w/ descriptions
    - potentially best to talk about it w/ slide


focus on wbs/schedule, but need full progress update on everything else
20 min presentation + 5 for questions



-------Planning Notes
Read in a series of straight lines and arcs (circles given in similar format to matplotlib)
	L endpoint1_x endpoint1_y endpoint2_x endpoint2_y
	A center_x center_y radius starting_degree(wrt to pointing up)
Separate up by 2 robots (greedy)
	Pick leftmost 
	Add to left, tally left cost
	Calculate rightmost
	Add to right tally right cost
	Whichever has the lower cost, pick next segment, continue
Re order paths (greedy)
	Pick closest to start, then take that path
	From ending of that path pick next closest

Produce path - array of locations by taking drawings + connecting segments from line to line
Generate a series of reference velocities thus producing a trajectory
Compute collisions and add timing breaks
Integrate velocity commands and display execution of path on screen as video
Then execute on real robot, use sensor fusion for dead reckoning + overhead camera
