\subsection{Work Scheduling, Distribution and Planning}
\label{sec:verification_sdp}


\subsubsection{Performance Tests}
\label{sec:sdp_pt}

how consistent is the planner at determining executable plans
acceptance criteria: plans do not involve robot collision or out of bounds

parallelism test - how efficiently is execution time distributed. Execution time is the total time robots spend moving to complete the drawing
metric: min[ exec(r0), exec(r1) ] / max[ exec(r0), exec(r1) ]


parallelism test - how efficiently is draw time distributed. Draw time is how long individual robots spend drawing on the ground vs. moving around
metric: min[ draw(r0), draw(r1) ] / max[ draw(r0), draw(r1) ]

how efficient are the two robots at working together.
metric = (time, 2 robots) / (time, 1 robot)
acceptance criteria - optimal speedup of 2x from requirements spec

\subsubsection{Functional Tests}
\label{sec:sdp_ft}

are plans generated collision free

autonomy test - does the system require no user input beyond adding the image to be drawn (exception being error handling)



\subsubsection{Failure Modes}
\label{sec:sdp_fm}
\njnote{Fail: unable to generate plan}
