\section{Power System}
\label{sec:power_system}
The power system supplies power to the rest of the system. Each robot has an onboard battery that is small and light enough to satisfy the size and weight requirements (\nfrref{nfr:weight_limit}, \nfrref{nfr:size_limit}), but also provides enough uptime to last a entire drawing session. The power system will satisfy battery life and contribute to portability requirements. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Critical Components:} Battery, voltage regulator modules.

\noindent
\textbf{Planned Trade Study:} \added[remark={RH, V2}]{We are continuing to investigate the power system and will have an evaluation of our research soon.}

\subsection{Requirements Fulfilled}
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{In prototyping our power system, we will have to satisfy the kill switch requirement (\frref{fr:kill_switch}) while also using a battery that will allow each robot to operate for at least half an hour (\frref{fr:battery_power}). We will also balance having a power system that allow for smooth error handling (\nfrref{nfr:errors}), is within our weight and size restrictions (\nfrref{nfr:weight_limit}, \nfrref{nfr:size_limit}), budget (\nfrref{nfr:budget}), and is reliable (\nfrref{nfr:reliability}) and safe (\nfrref{nfr:safe}).}
