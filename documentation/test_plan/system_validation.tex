\njnote{Fail: out of bounds - uses localization, locomotion}
\njnote{Fail: robot makes incorrect mark on ground - uses locomotion, localization, writing implement}
\njnote{Fail: collision between robots - uses locomotion, localization}
\njnote{Fail: nonuniform/flat surface - assumptions(?) causes slippage}


Test: do the drive commands respect physical robot capabilities. This relates to whether they robot can drive/draw at the same time w/o marker getting stuck. Also, is there a speed threshold at which drawing quality degrades - involves writing implement, locomotion

Test: does an individual robot draw accurately relative to the commanded motion. This involves making sure line aren't jagged/squiggly, etc. come up with better words for this

Test: does the robot fulfill size requirements. CHECK REQ SPEC FOR VALUES

Test: does the robot fulfill weight requirements. CHECK REQ SPEC FOR VALUES

Test: is the robot safe, aka does it not have pointy (sharp) edges on the outside

Test/verification: Was robot system price within budget
metric: dollars
acceptance criteria: 2500 dollars
