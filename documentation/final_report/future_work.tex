\section{Future Work and Commercialization Considerations}
\label{sec:future_work}

\subsection{Economic Factors}
- also selling and producing paint
- selling spare parts
- giving training for operating new robots
- mass production for larger robots
- variable sizes
- rent or buy (i.e airports rent for a week, sports might buy them)

\subsection{Reliability}
- change robot material such that it doesnt use wood
- deal with non flat surfaces
- better communication with less latency
- weather resistant exterior
- verification of correct drawings, possibly with drones
- more feedback with sensors, use encoders

\subsection{Safety}
- safer loading
- local collision detection
- coordinate with air traffic control for airports or coordinate with road traffic for roads

\subsection{Maintainability}
- longer battery power
- more robust painting mechanism, with longer maintenance cycles (dont have to shake marker)
- service contract
- geo-location "Find My Robot"
- More clear Documentation
- protection against drawing materials leaking if we use paint
- resource management of paint and battery

\subsection{Sustainability}
- Eco-friendly paint
- solar power
- offline storage and charging
- eco-friendly materials and manufacturing
- recycle old robots

\subsection{Ethical Issues}
- liability for caused accidents
- theft-deterrence, can offline "lock it"

\subsection{Marketability}
- scan in plans as easy input
- use more than 2 robots, like a swarm
- can use for airport line, road lines, sports and field lines
- input the type of drawing surface so you can use different driving patterns for the surfaces
- App with status updates of robot progress
- able to work at night for roadwork
- bright lights, sign, reflective for road work
- can strike lines like in road work
- dev kit so kids can hack it

\subsection{Social Issues}
- taking jobs and making jobs
- saves lives because reduces highway worker deaths

\subsection{Technical Issues}
- better collision detection
- vision
- specifying colors
