\subsection{User Interface}
\label{sec:software_ui}
The user interface is a graphical interface that provides the user the option to enter settings, start, pause, and stop drawing execution, and display error messages. The interface will be written in Python using the Tkinter library \cite{python_tkinter}. This library makes for a straightforward interface to set user options, as well as display any warnings or errors during the drawing process. The interface will be run concurrently with the offboard control software.
