\subsection{Locomotion}
\label{sec:hardware_locomotion}

\subsubsection{Fabrication Procedure}
\label{sec:locomotion_fab}
As indicated in the exploded view \yjnote{proper reference to the image needed}, the locomotion system contains four mecanum wheels, four motors, and a chassis. Mecanum wheels and motors will be purchased from vendors: Roboshop and Pololu. The robot chassis will be laser cut with acrylic.

\subsubsection{Assembly Instruction}
\label{sec:locomotion_assemb}
1. Attach mecanum wheels to motors.
2. Slide motor cases on the four motors. 
3. Screw in the four motor-wheel assemblies to the acryilc chassis.

\subsubsection{Electronics}
\label{sec:locomotion_electronics}
On each robot, the Raspberry Pi will be connected to an Adafruit DC Motor HAT, which is able to controll all 4 DC motors on the robot. Communication between the Raspberry Pi and the Motor HAT will be handled through the GPIO pins on the Pi.
