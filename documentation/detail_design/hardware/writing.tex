\subsubsection{Fabrication Procedure}
\label{sec:writing_fab}
As shown in the exploded view of the painting mechanism \figref{fig:painting-diagram}, this subsystem contains six componenents: bearing, liquid chalk marker, chalk holder, rotor, motor holder, and motor. Bearing, liquid chalk marker, and motor will be purchased online. These off-the-shelf components are from vendors: McMaster, Amazon, and Pololu, respectively. The other three components, due to their complex geometry, will be 3D printed.

\subsubsection{Assembly Instruction}
\label{sec:writing_assemb}
1. Screw the chalk holder inside the rotor.\\
2. Slide the rotor into the motor holder. \\
3. Align the motor with the D-shape hole on the top of the rotor and with the motor housing on the top of the motor holder.\\
4. Press fit the bearing into the motor holder.\\
5. Asseble the mechanism on the chassis.\\
6. Due to the 3D printed ribs inside the chalk holder, users can then install and uninstall liquid chalk markers with ease.
