\section{Failure States and Recovery}
\label{sec:failure_states}

\njnote{probably best to organize failure states/recovery by subsystem section for describing fault recovery and "degraded modes" similar to failure modes from test plan}

\subsection{Degraded Mode: Driving but Not Drawing}
Causes: out of writing material OR writing up/down mechanism broke
Recovery: Person pauses system and fixes it 

\subsection{Degraded Mode: Erratic Driving or Drawing}
Causes: Inaccurate motion or failure to move omni or incorrect localization or loss of connection or battery problems or out of bounds
Recovery: SHUT IT DOWN

\subsection{Degraded Mode: Planning Failure}
Causes: Unable to generate valid path
Recovery: Cant do that. Pick a new image
