\njnote{Fail: out of bounds - uses localization, locomotion}
\njnote{Fail: robot makes incorrect mark on ground - uses locomotion, localization, writing implement}
\njnote{Fail: collision between robots - uses locomotion, localization}
\njnote{Fail: nonuniform/flat surface - assumptions(?) causes slippage}


Test: do the drive commands respect physical robot capabilities. This relates to whether they robot can drive/draw at the same time w/o marker getting stuck. Also, is there a speed threshold at which drawing quality degrades
