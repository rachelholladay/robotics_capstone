\subsection{Image Processing}
\label{sec:verification_image}


\subsubsection{Performance Tests}
\label{sec:image_pt}

how closely does image processor output resemble original image
metric - image distance metrics

\subsubsection{Functional Tests}
\label{sec:image_ft}

can the image processor return data usable by the planner (series of lines)

does the image processor reject improper input

does the image processor keep lines to be drawn within bounds

\subsubsection{Failure Modes}
\label{sec:image_fm}
\njnote{Fail: unable to process user input image}
