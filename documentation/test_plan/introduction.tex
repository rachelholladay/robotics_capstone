\added[remark={NJ, V2}]{
This document provides a test plan for our robotics capstone project. The purpose is to provide a series of tests to verify and validate system design and implementation. Tests involve one or more subsystems, and can either validate design decisions or verify successful system operation. The test plan also documents cases in which the parts of system may fail, as well as describing the risk involved and methods to avoid these incidents. The tests described are designed to fully test requirements of this system.}
