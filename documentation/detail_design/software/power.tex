\subsection{Power System}
\label{sec:software_power}
Power system software is in charge solely of checking the battery power level of robot agents. As a part of the communication pipeline, battery information is sent as a part of logging information back to the offboard system \sref{sec:software_comm}. The offboard system will compare current battery level to the maximum level, and will pause or stop system operation when the battery falls below a threshold. This will prevent the system from entering a state of undefined behavior when not enough current can be supplied. Power system control is handled by Python \cite{python27} in the main controller. This is done for simplicity, as proto3 messages are parsed in the same place \sref{sec:software_comm_libs}.
