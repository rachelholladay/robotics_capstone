\item R\added[remark={NJ,V2.2}]{obots must be able to move instantaneously in any commanded direction on a 2D plane represented by the floor of motion. Omnidirectional movement is necessary to ensure agents can adequately and efficiently cover the drawing workspace, while simultaneously being able to draw lines of varying curvature.}
