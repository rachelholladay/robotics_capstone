\label{sec:hardware_localization}

The localization system is comprised of a ceiling-mounted webcam with full view of the workspace. AprilTags will be mounted on the corners of the workspace to allow the system to determine its boundaries. Tags will also be mounted on the robots for the system to determine their locations within the workspace. The webcam will be connected to the central laptop with a USB cable.
