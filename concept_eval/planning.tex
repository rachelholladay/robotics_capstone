\section{Work Scheduling, Distribution and Planning}
\label{sec:planning}
\textbf{Description:} Given the output from the image processor (\sref{sec:subsystem_image_processor}), and parameters such as the number of robots and the size of the workspace, the module determines the work that will be distributed to each robot. See software architecture (\sref{sec:software_architecture}) for more information. Planning between robots allows for coordination and efficiency, satisfying requirements for both (Requirements Specification, 5.2, NFR2, NFR7). \\
\textbf{Critical Components:} Scheduling and distribution algorithm. \\
