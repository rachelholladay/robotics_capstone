\subsection{Image Processing}
\label{sec:software_image}
Image processing involves the user inputting a series of lines, and converting it into a format usable by the planner. The planner takes an ordered series of lines, and the image processing subsystem will perform this task. This system will create the ordered lines using Python \cite{python27} and OpenCV \cite{opencv24}.
