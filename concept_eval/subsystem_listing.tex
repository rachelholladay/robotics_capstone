\section{Subsystem Listing}
\label{sec:subsystem_listing}

The remainder of this document is split based on the various susbystems. We briefly describe each subsystem here.

Writing Implement (\sref{sec:writing_implement}): The mechanism that uses the writing tool to deposit material onto the writing surface. \\
Locomotion (\sref{sec:locomotion}): This system involves robot motion across the writing surface. \\
Localization (\sref{sec:localization}): All pieces of the robot system involved with determining position and orientation of the robot agents within the drawing space. \\
Image Processing (\sref{sec:image_processing}): Taking a user-created image and processing into a format usable by the work scheduler (\sref{sec:planning}). \\
Work Scheduling, Distribution, and Planning (\sref{sec:planning}): Determines trajectories for individual robots to complete the drawing, based on the user's input image. \\
Communication (\sref{sec:communication}): This subsystem involves all communication from robot agents to the offboard system. \\
User Interface (\sref{sec:user_interface}): A unified system for user input and interaction into the system. \\
Power System (\sref{sec:power_system}): Supplies power to all necessary parts of the robot system.
