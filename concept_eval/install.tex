\section{Installation}
\label{sec:install}

The system's setup requires a drawing surface and vision markers under specific conditions. Conditions for setup must be in line with the scope and assumptions made for successful operation of the system. Maintaining scope of the project, as described in the requirements specification (Requirements Specification, 2.3), the drawing surface must be placed indoors and in an obstacle-free area. For compliance with surface requirements (Requirements Specification, 2.4, A1), the surface chosen must be a flat and homogenous surface.

Once the drawing surface has been placed indoors on a flat surface, vision markers must be set up and calibrated. As per \sref{sec:trade_localization}, localization markers must be placed around the edges of the drawing surface. These markers must then be calibrated by the user, who will input marker locations into the system. The localization markers serve as calibrated base points from which the robot agents will determine their position and orientation.
