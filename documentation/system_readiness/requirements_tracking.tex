\subsection{Requirements Traceability Matrix}
\label{sec:requirements_matrix}

We present our requirements traceability matrix in \figref{fig:req_matrix}. We categorize our requirements into functional and nonfunctional requirements. For each requirement, we classify which subsystem it relates to: writing, communication, locomotion, localization, SDP (scheduling, distribution and planning) and mechanical structure. Each requirement is coloered green if initial testing has shown that we achieve the requirement.
