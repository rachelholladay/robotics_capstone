\section{Trade Studies}
\label{sec:trade_studies}

\rhnote{Rubric: Conduct trade studies when there are significant alternatives. Describe trade studies (use comparative analysis techniques) and results. Trade studies present for all major design decisions and clearly identify reasons for choices. If no choice is made, a prototyping plan is identified.}

\rhnote{IDK what a trade study is so I looked it up. According to google: "A trade study or trade-off study is the activity of a multidisciplinary team to identify the most balanced technical solutions among a set of proposed viable solutions (FAA 2006). These viable solutions are judged by their satisfaction of a series of measures or cost functions."}
