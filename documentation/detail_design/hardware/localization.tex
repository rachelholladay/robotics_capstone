\subsubsection{Fabrication Procedure}
\label{sec:localization_fab}
The localization system is comprised of a ceiling-mounted webcam with full view of the workspace and AR markers (AprilTags) mounted the robots and on the four corners of the workspace. A ceiling-mounted webcam will be purchased online from Amazon. AprilTags will be printed on paper and attached to the robots and on the bounds of the writing area. As shown in the exploded view \figref{fig:localization-diagram}, four marker supporters are required to mount the AR marker on each robot. These supporters will be made out of laser patterned acrylic.
