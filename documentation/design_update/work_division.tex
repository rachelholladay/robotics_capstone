\section{Work Division}
\label{sec:work_division}

We outline the individual contributions of each team member with respect to technical and nontechnical work.

Technical development and implementation has been separated as shown in the WBS (\sref{sec:wbs}). Eric is in charge of mechanical design and implementation. Software development has been split between Neil, Don, and Rachel. Rachel is in charge of the planning and work distribution subsystem; Don is working on locomotion, localization and UI. Neil is in charge of the communication subsystem, and ensuring software subsystem integration. Full system testing and integration is to be done by the entire team.

Nontechnical work involves scheduling and updating the WBS, risk management, and overall project management. Neil works on updating the schedule, Don is in charge of maintaining WBS accuracy, and Eric focuses on analyzing risk throughout project implementation. Rachel is in charge of project management, however the team works together to make major decisions regarding schedule and scope changes.
