\subsubsection{UI Navigation}
\label{sec:ui_fm_navigation}
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Description:} This failure occurs when a user is unable to navigate the UI to setup and begin the autonomous drawing process.} \\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Cause:} Causes of this effect could be an unintuitive user interface, a UI that lacks features necessary to run the system, or lack of user training to use the interface properly.} \\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Effects:} The only effect is that the system is unable to begin the drawing process.} \\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Criticality:} UI failure is noncritical to system operation, as the system can run without a graphical interface. However, it is critical for demo purposes as a demo user must be able to begin system operation.}\\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Safety Hazards:} No safety hazards are posed by this failure mode.}\\
\added[remark={DZ, V2}]{\textbf{Mitigation:} A clear and intuitive UI design as well as a short training phase for human operators can help mitigate this failure mode.}
