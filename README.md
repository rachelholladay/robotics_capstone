## File Structure

The codebase is separated into the two main controllers, and subsystems
for both onboard and offboard operation.

## Linting Code

We use Pylint to lint all of our python files. To run the linter with customized flags, use `pylint --rcfile='../../.pylintrc' filname.py` such that the firectory references back to the overhead folder where the rc file is located.
