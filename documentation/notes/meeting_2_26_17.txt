QUESTIONS TO ASK
what is project management in the context of this presentation
    schedule updates? need to confirm/deny and are we missing anything

STATE OF DEVELOPMENT
    come up with dev updates, then each make slide or two
    - Camera rig assembly - going to build out of 80/20 instead of wood
        b/c easier assembly
    - NOTE: Only talk about progress, not relative to schedule
    - finished: SDP, communication, UI ahead of schedule, locomotion 
        ahead of schedule, localization beginning this week
    - finished: chassis done, writing implement in progress/finishing this week
        - camera rig assembly simplified, only slightly delayed (<1week)
        - mechanical slightly delayed b/c parts came in later than expected

    - we named our robots!!!!! blue and bad

    - TODO pick some SDP examples to show, talk about in-progress UI and
        updated SDP algorithm

PROJECT MANAGEMENT
    - provide schedule update - talk about being ahead/behind in areas here
         see state of dev for list of being ahead/behind
    - Moved UI subsystem dev to end of spring break - time to work at end 
        of break, so moved it to better spread out rest of work

RISK MANAGEMENT - need table:
    jan 26 slides, slide 20

    Unexpected costs (things cost too much, run out of budget, blahblah)
    Defective parts - motors we buy are bad and burn out early
    Running off schedule - machine shop closed, parts backordered, etc.
    Unavailable group member (sickness, travel, death, sickness during travel)
    Software packages incompatible (RACHEL DEFINE THIS ONE)
    Mechanical failure - chassis breaks, wheels break, etc.
    Scheduling system fails to meet efficiency standards/requirements
    High latency between offboard and onboard
    Inability to power onboard system
    Short circuits damaging electrical systems
    Overhead camera not sufficient for localization
        Overhead camera data too distorted
    Writing tool (market) works poorly - doesn't draw well, out of ink quickly
    Mecanums cause too much vibration for smooth writing
    Unable to achieve desired 3D printing tolerance
        parts not being right sized, not being strong enough
    Friction between mecanums and surface not high enough (causes slippage)
        high consequence, low likelihood
    Inability to easily access or maintain specific parts
        similar to MRSD Project example in jan 26 slides
    Project lacks sufficient risk for chart (lol don't add this)
    Motor PID control oscillates too much/inability to tune
        risk reduction plan can include better tuning
    Camera rig difficult to transport - limits demo capabilities
        can also take longer as we would have to rebuild smaller
