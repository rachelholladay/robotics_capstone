Meeting w/ DW about test plan 12/7

WRITING IMPLEMENT
focus on refilling resovoir over waterproof

IMPLEMENTATION
drawing lines vs text
parameterizing lines, circles, 

TEST PLAN
prioritize failure modes
failure table - include likelihood of occurence, detectability, criticality

move current risk management ones to failure modes
  relates to adding failure table, add info relating to fault table
risk management is "summary of failure modes/how to handl risk"
  includes failure table
  summary can be a part of the table itself

ex. of mitigation - battery monitoring process
  battery has to be removed to be charged, someone must be present while battery is charging
  ex. not so great example, but put sticker on battery labeling it
risk mitigation refers to specific actions to be taken to reduce risk of something
  --> but it can be a process
ex. for intruder collision - risk mitigation is putting up sign showing robots are workign, or if criticality is low then perhaps don't need to do anything
