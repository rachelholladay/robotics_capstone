\subsubsection{Fail to Plan}
\label{sec:sdp_fm_planning}
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Description:} This failure mode occurs when the offboard system is unable to generate a valid plan for the robot agents. This means the main controller is unable to command the robots to successfully complete the input drawing.}\\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Cause:} Failure to create a valid plan could arise from an out of bounds drawing. Other reasons include the image processing result being incorrect, which forces the work planner to incorrectly assign and generate plans.}\\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Effect:} The system is unable to complete an invalid drawing, and cannot begin autonomous operation.} \\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Criticality:} This is a system-critical failure due to the fact that the system cannot recreate the drawing if it cannot generate a robot motion plan to do so.} \\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Safety Hazards:} There are no safety hazards associated with this failure mode, given that it is entirely software-based.}
