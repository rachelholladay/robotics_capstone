\section{Power System}
\label{sec:power_system}
\textbf{Description:} The power system supplies power to the rest of the system. Each robot has an onboard battery that is small and light enough to satisfy the size and weight requirement, but also provides enough uptime to last a entire drawing session. The power system will satisfy battery life and contribute to portability requirements (Requirements Specification, 5.2, NFR1, NFR6). \\
\textbf{Critical Components:} Battery, voltage regulator modules. \\
