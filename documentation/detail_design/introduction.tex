\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This document provides implementation details for our robotics capstone project. This involves software, hardware, and overall system design. It includes parts lists and software libraries to be used, as well as assembly and setup instructions. Software architecture is described in detail enough to recreate using the same architecture and libraries. This document serves as a detailed description that can allow a 3rd party to recreate the project. In addition, system designed is traced back to the original requirements, and includes models to better define system architecture and usage.
