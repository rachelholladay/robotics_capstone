\subsection{Writing Implement}
\label{sec:verification_writing_implement}

\subsubsection{Performance Tests}
\label{sec:writing_pt}
able to load/move/replace tool within req time limit (10s)
metric = duration

test quality of mark made by writing implement
metric TBD, could be thickness relative to person using tool(?)


\subsubsection{Functional Tests}
\label{sec:writing_ft}
bool - able to load/move/replace tool
metric = yes/no

bool - can motors be actuated to move up/down, tests the motors
metric = yes/no

bool - can writing implement system be controlled, tests controllers
metric = yes/no

bool - does writing implement make mark when pushed down
metric = yes/no

bool - can locomote and draw with tool simultaneously
need to make sure it doesn't get stuck
speed threshold? aka how fast before poor drawing quality/tool breaks, etc.
metric = yes/no

bool - can force sensor measure force being applied well enough to distinguish between states (states = optimal, underactuated, overactuated)

\subsubsection{Failure Mode: Out of Writing Material}
\label{sec:writing_fm_ink}
\textbf{Description:} This failure mode describes the situation when a writing implement is loaded inside a robot agent, and runs out of writing material. \\
\textbf{Cause:} Overuse of the writing implement.\\
\textbf{Effects:} The robot agent moves around and attempts to continue drawing, without making physical marks.\\
\textbf{Criticality:} This is a critical failure, as it requires the user to replace the implement before drawing can continue. If the user fails to replace the implement, lines will be missing from the drawing.\\
\textbf{Safety Hazards:} There are no safety hazards associated with this failure mode.\\

\subsubsection{Failure Mode: Writing Mechanism Failure}
\label{sec:writing_fm_mechanism}
\textbf{Description:} This failure occurs when the mechanism that raises and lowers the writing implement does not work. This causes the robot to be incapable of either drawing a line, or moving on the writing surface without drawing a line.\\
\textbf{Cause:} This is caused by a communication failure, as described by \sref{comm_fm_loss}, or more likely, by the raise/lowering mechanism breaking.\\
\textbf{Effects:} The robot agent will be unable to alter whether or not it is writing as it moves. This can cause either missing lines or incorrect ones, depending on the state of the writing mechanism.\\
\textbf{Criticality:} This is a critical error as it directly affects the quality of the lines being drawn. Users can resolve this issue after receiving an error report to continue operation. However, it is possible the drawing has been compromised.\\
\textbf{Safety Hazards:} There are no safety hazards associated with this failure mode.\\
