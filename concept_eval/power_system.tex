\section{Power System}
\label{sec:power_system}
The power system supplies power to the rest of the system. Each robot has an onboard battery that is small and light enough to satisfy the size and weight requirement, but also provides enough uptime to last a entire drawing session. The power system will satisfy battery life and contribute to portability requirements. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Critical Components:} Battery, voltage regulator modules. 

\noindent
\textbf{Planned Trade Study:} \added[remark={RH, V2}]{We are continuing to investigate power system and will have an evaluation of our research soon.}

\subsection{Requirements Fulfilled}
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{In prototyping our power system, we will have to satisify have a kill switch (FR13) while using a battery that will allow each robot to operate for at least half an hour (FR15). We will also balance having a power system that allow for smooth error handling (NFR2), is within our weight (NFR3), size (NFR4) and budget (NFR10) restrictions, and is reliable (NFR8) and safe (NFR11).}
