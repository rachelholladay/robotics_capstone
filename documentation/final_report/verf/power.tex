\subsubsection{Performance Test: Battery Life}
\label{test:power_pt_battery}
\textbf{Test Question:} How long can an individual robot run for on a single battery charge? \\
\textbf{Operational Procedure:} Charge a robot fully. Command the robot to complete an input drawing repeatedly until the robot is fully drained of power. Time how long this takes. \\
\textbf{Metric:} The duration of operational time given one charge \\
\textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} We accept this if the operational time exceeds the necessary duration time of 90\% of our test drawing inputs. \\
\textbf{Requirement(s) Verified:} NFR7
