\section{Installation}
\label{sec:install}

In addition to the robot system itself, the system installation will require:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Adequately sized indoor drawing surface
	\item Localization markers
	\item Overhead camera mount
	\item Writing implement
\end{itemize}

We will be using an indoor obstacle-free surface in accordance with our requirements specification (Requirements Specification, 2.3, 2.4 A1) which placed outdoor, non-homogenous drawing surfaces and obstacles out of scope. 

We will set up the localization markers on the corners of the working surface, as well as atop the robots themselves. The system can then identify and calibrate to the localization markers to track the working surface and the robots. We will also adjust the camera mount so that it allows the system's camera a full, unobstructed view of the working surface. Finally, we will place the robots at set locations on the working surface and generate the input image.
