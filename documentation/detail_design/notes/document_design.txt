Sections are vaguely ordered
Top level = section
  - title = subsection
  text = description of what goes there


Introduction/Document Description
  describes what detail design doc is for
  also describes organization of doc - parts defined, then overall system operational modes and diagrams, then implementation, then fault-recovery

Parts list
  - part, contains price(?), quantity, link to item, anything else relevant?

System States/Operational Modes
  "define system states and operational modes to support concept of operation"
    not sure about this, maybe have the full system diagram from previous doc?
  "define temporal aspects with statecharts or other models"
    not really sure what to include here either

System Diagrams
  - Intro specifying that diagrams are for components/full system hardware
    all diagrams have short description
  - Full System Diagrams (multiple views)
  - Component diagrams
  - Wiring diagrams

Hardware Fabrication Process
  "explain the fabrication and implementation process"
  - Subsystem 1-N
    not sure if this should be split by subsystem, maybe only for hw subsystems
  - Assembly Instructions
    required according to instructions, this can fit all hw subsystems together

Software Implementation Process
  - Design hierarchy
    "object oriented" or "structured design"
    probably best to split this into software subsections
  - Software Libraries/Packages
    list of software libraries (apriltags, python, c++, protobuf, etc.)
  - Subsystem 1-N
    only for software subsystems
    describe how each subsystem uses some of the libraries and how that subsystem works in detail

Failure States & Recovery
  - Subsystem 1-N and Full System
    probably best to organize failure states/recovery by subsystem
  section for describing fault recovery and "degraded modes"
  similar to failure modes from test plan

Installation Plan
  "includes size, weight, power, other resource needs"

Traceability Matrix
  "detailed design should make clear how system meets functional and non-functional requirements, can be done by tracing requirements to design attributes"
  Maybe another table linking requirements to sub/subsub sections in the doc

References
  bibliography of parts and links for research or something?
  "provides references to source material"
