\subsection{Writing Implement}
\label{sec:verification_writing_implement}

\subsubsection{Performance Tests}
\label{sec:writing_pt}
able to load/move/replace tool within req time limit (10s)
metric = duration

test quality of mark made by writing implement
metric TBD, could be thickness relative to person using tool(?)


\subsubsection{Functional Tests}
\label{sec:writing_ft}
bool - able to load/move/replace tool
metric = yes/no

bool - can motors be actuated to move up/down, tests the motors
metric = yes/no

bool - can writing implement system be controlled, tests controllers
metric = yes/no

bool - does writing implement make mark when pushed down
metric = yes/no

bool - can locomote and draw with tool simultaneously
need to make sure it doesn't get stuck
speed threshold? aka how fast before poor drawing quality/tool breaks, etc.
metric = yes/no

bool - can force sensor measure force being applied well enough to distinguish between states (states = optimal, underactuated, overactuated)

\subsubsection{Failure Modes}
\label{sec:writing_fm}
\njnote{Fail: out of ink}
\njnote{Fail: mechanism failure - unable to raise/lower}
