\section{Full System Validation}
\label{sec:system_validation}




Test: do the drive commands respect physical robot capabilities. This relates to whether they robot can drive/draw at the same time w/o marker getting stuck. Also, is there a speed threshold at which drawing quality degrades - involves writing implement, locomotion

Test: does an individual robot draw accurately relative to the commanded motion. This involves making sure line aren't jagged/squiggly, etc. come up with better words for this

Test: does the robot fulfill size requirements. CHECK REQ SPEC FOR VALUES

Test: does the robot fulfill weight requirements. CHECK REQ SPEC FOR VALUES

Test: is the robot safe, aka does it not have pointy (sharp) edges on the outside

Test/verification: Was robot system price within budget
metric: dollars
acceptance criteria: 2500 dollars


\njnote{Fail: out of bounds - uses localization, locomotion}
\njnote{Fail: robot makes incorrect mark on ground - uses locomotion, localization, writing implement}
\njnote{Fail: collision between robots - uses locomotion, localization}
\njnote{Fail: nonuniform/flat surface - assumptions(?) causes slippage}

\subsubsection{Failure Mode: Fail to Plan}
\label{sec:sys_val_fm_bounds}
\njnote{Fail: unable to generate plan}

\textbf{Description:} This failure mode occurs when the offboard system is unable to generate a valid plan for the robot agents. This means the main controller is unable to command the robots to successfully complete the input drawing.\\
\textbf{Cause:} Failure to create a valid plan could arise from an out of bounds drawing. Other reasons include the image processing result being incorrect, which forces the work planner to incorrectly assign and generate plans.\\
\textbf{Effect: The system is unable to complete an invalid drawing, and cannot begin autonomous operation.}
\textbf{Criticality: This is a system-critical failure due to the fact that the system cannot recreate the drawing if it cannot generate a robot motion plan to do so.} \\
\textbf{Safety Hazards: There are no safety hazards associated with this failure mode, given that it is entirely software-based.} \\
