DW MEETING 12/8

GENERAL TODO
- RH add hyperlinks on figrefs
- DZ explain wiring explanations (in fabrication procedure)
- DZ add proper figrefs for wiring figures
- general explanation for electronics explanation, how wired up
- link Failure States back to test plan failure modes

GENERAL
- uniformly good
  - mechanical, electrical, software good
- not much negative (we are great)

MECHANICAL
- chassis, drivetrain, torque, voltage
- motor
  - have to specify motor - link is a line of motors, not specific one
  - add manufacturer/part# to ensure actual motor can be

- mecanum wheels
  - not smooth, rattle a lot
  - rigidity of structure/compliance to account for mecanum rattle/bumpiness
  - potential fix: rubber something(?)

- schematic
  - motors on plastic
  - needs detail of how motors attached
    - lasercut hole with bolt/nuts
    - be aware of motor mounting
    - be aware of shaking

TRACEABILITY
- it refs requirements back to sections of doc
- NFR 4 -> Section 2
  - should also link to drawing mechanism/pen (2.3?)

- instead, look at req and point reqs to which systems they point to

ELECTRONICS
- electronics diagrams needs a proper figref
- expand 2.3, electronics diagram
  - explain which wires being connected to what
  - explain purpose of the connections
  - for example, explain that which pin on the rpi the motors connect to and/or why it doesn't matter which pin it's connected to
- link figure 9 with a figref
- may want to explain that the pics are just examples of the different figures

FABRICATION PROCEDURE
- would be nice to see wiring explanations
- 4.6.1 needs actual fabrication procedure especially for electronics

SOFTWARE
- explain external/environment in software section
  - how it's just the passive markers going into input
  - DW thought the
- Figure 11
  - explain what arrows in the sw arch are
  - may want to explain data flow between
- Figure 12 communication diagram
  - explain color coding here too
  - potentially change box types?
- proto3 messages
  - table of message data types contained - explain all the data fields
  - contain type of each data type (ex e-stop is boolean, motor command is numerical value, etc.)

FAILURE STATES/RECOVERY
- TODO reference test plan failure modes
