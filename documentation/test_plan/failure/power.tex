\subsubsection{Insufficient Battery}
\label{sec:power_fm_battery}
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Description:} This failure mode arises when the battery for an individual robot agent is low or out of power.}\\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Cause:} Insufficient battery power is a result of overuse of the battery from autonomously drawing for too long.}\\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Effect:} The result is a robot agent being unable to move, draw, or communicate with the offboard system, as it has no subsystems being powered.}\\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Criticality:} This failure is critical, as it can pause and/or end robot operation. Robot agent battery must be replaced before operation can continue.}\\
\added[remark={RH, V2}]{\textbf{Safety Hazards:} There are no safety hazards that result from the battery being low or out of power.}\\
\added[remark={DZ, V2}]{\textbf{Mitigation:} Regular battery level inspections and using reliable batteries can help mitigate this failure mode.}
