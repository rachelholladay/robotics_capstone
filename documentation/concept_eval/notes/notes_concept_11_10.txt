MEETING NOTES 11/10
Met with DW as group to talk about concept eval and prototyping 

for reqs like weight/size, best to approximate - basically a sanity check
  ensure we won't fail the requirement

image processing section
  'why' comment - need to justify why do this instead of having user specify lines/points and doing that

  make sure to reflect that line segments found by processing reported back to user, and user OKs those lines


architecture diagrams
  definitely need sw diagram

installation section
  talk about minutia of deployment - how to get into field
    - need extension cords/tall mounts for top camera, etc.
    - any calibration needed for anything
    - how do robots get to working area (probably lifted)

  "think about people, equipment, environment that system is part of"


prototyping
  - testing relationships of overhead camera
  - writing implement testing (types - marker,chalk, etc.)
    - force needed to make marks/quality of marks made




TODO
Add small sentence explaining what labels in requirements table at the end are
