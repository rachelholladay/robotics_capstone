\subsubsection{Computation}
\label{sec:computation}
A laptop computer will handle all offboard computation. This includes image processing, planning, scheduling, localization, and managing communication with the robot workers. Only communications, a computationally light task, must be managed in real time. This means that the computational speed of the laptop is largely unimportant to proper operation of the system. 

Each robot worker will be equipped with a Raspberry Pi 3 to manage onboard computation, motor controller operation, and communication with the offboard system. The Raspberry Pi 3 is a fully functional Linux system with easily accessible GPIO pins, which can be used for the motor controller. It also has a built-in WiFi card, which simplifies communications and decreases the number of necessary parts.
