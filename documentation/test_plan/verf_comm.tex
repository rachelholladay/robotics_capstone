\subsection{Communication}
\label{sec:verification_comm}


\subsubsection{Performance Tests}
\label{sec:comm_pt}

reliability - what is the uptime on our ability to communicate data to robots
metric: percentage time running vs. bad connection
acceptance criteria: requirements spec say perfect/near perfect uptime

\subsubsection{Functional Tests}
\label{sec:comm_ft}

can data be sent to/from the robots and the server

is data sent using the same communication protocol/can be parsed by both ends of the system

\subsubsection{Failure Modes}
\label{sec:comm_fm}

\njnote{loss of connection - server side, robot/client side, no connection vs. intermittent are equivalent in handling}
\njnote{Send garbage/incorect data}
