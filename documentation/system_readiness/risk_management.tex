\section{Risk Management}
\label{sec:risk_management}

\dznote{Don update this with new information}

In this section, we revisit the risks defined by our previous document.\

\subsection{Risk 1: Defective Parts}

\caption{Risk 1: Defective Parts}
\label{fig:risk1}
\end{figure}
To deal with Risk 1 (\figref{fig:risk1}) we only ordered parts that have good reviews or that we have personal experience with. So far, we have not encountered any issues relating to this risk.

\subsection{Risk 2: Unavailable Member}
\begin{figure}[!ht]

\label{fig:risk2}
\end{figure}
To deal with Risk 2 (\figref{fig:risk2}) we are making sure that group members are constantly updated on the state of the project and what needs to be done. So far, we have not encountered any issues relating to this risk.

\subsection{Risk 3: Breaking Parts}
\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.98\columnwidth]{risks/risk3.JPG}
\caption{Risk 3: Breaking Parts}
\label{fig:risk3}
\end{figure}
To deal with Risk 3 (\figref{fig:risk3}) we are being extra careful around our parts. So far, we have broken a motor shaft, but built enough time into our schedule so that manufacturing a new one did not impede our build progress. We also had to fix a misaligned motor encoder.
